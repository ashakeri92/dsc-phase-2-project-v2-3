# Northwestern County 1st Time Home Buyer Analysis

**Authors**: Armun Shakeri

## Overview

This project analyzes homes available in today's housing market and examines which of those homes would be appropriate for a first time home buyer. Also how price of a home is affected by independent values like sqft_living and price.

## Business Problem

Recently property values have been increasing throughout the United States. For those wanting to buy their first home, there are many factors that might raise the price of that home. This project analyzes these factors and explores whether they have a positive or negative affect on price.

## Data

For this project we gathered information regading homes, including price, bedroom and bathroom count, sqft_living, sqft_basement, lat location, and grade. From there we had to filter homes that were appropriate for a first time home buyer. We set the price to <= $1,000,000, and set the amount of bedrooms to <= 10. Finally we created the dummy variables for our only categorical variable, grade.
